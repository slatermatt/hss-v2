My initial experience with the company was so positive that when I recently required storage for some personal and work related items they were an obvious choice. Lorraine is extremely helpful and offers excellent advice on what storage is most appropriate for the quantity of items that you wish to store. If you have a storage requirement I would highly recommend them.",

Various delays with our house purchase meant that we had to keep changing our plans, and I don't know how we would have fared without the flexibility that Lorraine offered. For the actual day of the move, we found that no rental vans were available, as we only had a confirmed date at the last minute, but were able to use the van from HSS for that day, and then book a rental van to slowly empty our units. Very friendly, helpful, flexible, and all at a very good price. Being able to park right next to the unit was another bonus. Thank you so much Lorraine!",
